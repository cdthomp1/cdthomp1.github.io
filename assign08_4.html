                <h2>The Art of Flight &#9992;</h2>
                <p>Since its beginning in 1926, Embry-Riddle has provided the industry with aviation personnel, one
                    student at a time. A pioneer in aviation education, Embry-Riddle is the most highly regarded
                    institution dedicated to the field.
                </p>
                <p>We are the nation’s largest, oldest, and most comprehensive aeronautical university. When you enroll
                    in an aviation-related degree program here, you can rest assured you will study a curriculum that
                    is at the forefront of the industry’s developments and demands for the future. </p>
                <p>Embry-Riddle sets the standards for aviation education and is involved with the formation of
                    national and international aviation policy.</p>
                <p>Flight students begin their one-on-one training within their first few days as a student. A
                    professional demeanor is demanded from the moment they climb into their “classroom in the sky.” </p>
